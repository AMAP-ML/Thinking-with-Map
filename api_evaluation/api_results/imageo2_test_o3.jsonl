Architecture & interior  \n   •  The church has a modern‐mid-century “A-frame” roof with light-coloured timber boarding and a dramatic brick reredos (altar wall) formed from vertical, slightly curved brick columns.  \n   •  The large back-lit cut-out cross and the red sanctuary lamp are features often found in Lutheran or Episcopal churches in North America that were built or remodelled in the 1950-1970 period.  \n   •  The materials (light tan brick, pale timber) and general aesthetic are typical of churches built in the Upper Midwest of the United States during that era.\n\n2. Liturgical details  \n   •  The arrangement of the altar rail and kneelers, and the presence of the red sanctuary candle, fit very well with Episcopal (Anglican) practice, which is common in the northern United States, especially around Minnesota/Wisconsin.  \n   •  The decorated flower cross in the aisle is a custom often seen in Lutheran and Episcopal congregations at Easter in this region.\n\n3. Geographic deduction  \n   •  Nothing in the image points to a specific named church, but the architectural style, liturgical fittings, and materials strongly suggest a mid-century Episcopal or Lutheran church in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota, USA.\n\nGiven the lack of unique signage or other unambiguous identifiers, I cannot pinpoint the exact church building, but the balance of clues makes suburban Minneapolis the most plausible single guess.\n\n{\n    \"lat\": 44.9778,\n    \"lon\": -93.2650,\n    \"city\": \"Minneapolis\",\n    \"country\": \"United States\"\n}"}

Missoula, Montana famously has two hillside letters: the big “M” on Mount Sentinel (south of the Clark Fork River) and a big white “L” on Mount Jumbo (north of the river) representing Loyola Sacred Heart High School.\n\n4. A river-side deck restaurant in Missoula with turquoise umbrellas and string lights matches “FINN” (the riverside restaurant at the DoubleTree by Hilton – Missoula Edgewater) which sits on the south bank of the Clark Fork River, looking north across the river toward Mount Jumbo and its big white “L”.\n\n5. The coordinates of the DoubleTree Edgewater / FINN restaurant are about 46.8709° N, –113.9907° W.\n\nTherefore the photo was very likely taken in Missoula, Montana, USA, on the deck of the FINN restaurant on the Clark Fork River.\n\n{\n    \"lat\": 46.8709,\n    \"lon\": -113.9907,\n    \"city\": \"Missoula\",\n    \"country\": \"United States\"\n}"}
