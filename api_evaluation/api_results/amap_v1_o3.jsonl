The green-and-white sign shows the familiar “ABC” logo followed by Chinese characters, which is typical of 中国农业银行 (Agricultural Bank of China) or a local rural-commercial bank. Either way, it is a very common sight on Chinese city streets.\n3. The style of the low-rise tiled residential/office building with many outside air-conditioner units, together with the metal newspaper kiosk and the glass-roof bus shelter, is characteristic of northern-Chinese large cities built up in the 1980s-1990s.\n4. Nothing in the picture gives a unique regional feature (mountains, coast, dialectal characters, minority languages, etc.), so we must rely on the most statistically common setting for this type of street furniture and building style.\n5.
