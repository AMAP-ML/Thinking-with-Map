Among India’s big tech hubs, Bengaluru (Bangalore) and Hyderabad both fit, but the paving style of the footpath, the landscaping, and the overall look of the surroundings match typical stretches of Bengaluru’s Outer Ring Road / Sarjapur–Marathahalli–Bellandur / Kadubeesanahalli area, where the new Namma Metro “ORR-AIRPORT” (Blue Line) work and many new tech–park buildings are found.\n4. The scene looks particularly like the junction and loop roads just south-east of the upcoming Kadubeesanahalli metro station on the Outer Ring Road.\n\nEstimated co-ordinates for that spot: roughly 12.93° N, 77.69° E.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n    \"lat\": 12.930,\n    \"lon\": 77.690,\n    \"city\": \"Bengaluru\",\n    \"country\": \"India\"\n}"}

Architecture: Mid-20th-century three-storey apartment blocks, rendered in pastel colours with small basement windows and simple rectangular window openings.

Paving: The walkway is made of small rectangular concrete pavers laid in a herring-bone pattern. That again is standard for Central-European housing estates.\n\n3. Cars: A closer look (zooming in) shows licence-plates that are white with a narrow blue stripe on the left and a black font consisting of two letters, a hyphen and four digits (e.g. “XX-1234”). That exact typography matches the Czech Republic. Slovak plates have two letters + three numbers + two letters; Polish plates begin with one letter followed by four or five digits/letters; Hungarian plates have three letters + three digits with a hyphen. This therefore is almost certainly the Czech Republic.\n\n4. Sign on the building: The small red-outlined street-plate next to the door is the classic style used in Prague (and most Czech cities): white text on a red background with a thin white border. It appears to read something like “…str.” and below a district number (again typical of Prague street plates). The building also has a small cream/blue corner – that is quite common in Prague’s 1920-30s “Bubeneč / Dejvice” workers’ housing estates.\n\n5. Environment: The courtyard with tall narrow Lombardy poplars is common in Prague inner suburbs. The apartment blocks opposite (light beige 4-storey plus attic with shallow hip roof) are also classic Prague post-war infill.\n\n6. The garages in the background (row garages) look identical to the ones behind the apartment blocks in Dejvice/Bubeneč (Prague 6), in the grid of streets between Jugoslávských partyzánů and the River Vltava.\n\nGiven all this, the most reasonable pinpoint is Prague, Czech Republic, in the residential estates of Dejvice/Bubeneč (roughly 50.107° N, 14.411° E).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n    \"lat\": 50.107,\n    \"lon\": 14.411,\n    \"city\": \"Prague\",\n    \"country\": \"Czech Republic\"\n}"}
