The building style and street layout are consistent with central Sofia, particularly around the area near the city center.\n\nThe ornate building on the left and the overall urban composition suggest this could be along one of Sofia's main boulevards, possibly near Vitosha Boulevard or in the central district.\n\n{\n    \"lat\": 42.6977,\n    \"lon\": 23.3219,\n    \"city\": \"Sofia\",\n    \"country\": \"Bulgaria\"\n}"}
